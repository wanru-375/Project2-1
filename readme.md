## Keras introduction
Keras is a Python deep learning framework that makes it easy to define and train almost any type of deep learning model. Keras was originally developed for researchers to experiment quickly

Keras has the following important features:
1. The same code can be seamlessly switched between CPU and GPU
2. User-friendly APIs that facilitate rapid development of prototypes of deep learning models
3. Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), circular networks (for sequence processing) and any combination of the two.
4. Support any network architecture: multi-input or multi-output model, layer sharing, model sharing, etc.

## Typical Keras workflow:
-  Define training data: input tensor and target tensor
-  Define a network composed of layers to map input to targets
-  Configuration learning process: selecting loss function, optimizer and indicators to be monitored
-  The FIT method of the model is called to iterate on the training data

## Install：
We  installed the installation package for this project：
-  Unity
-  Livelossplot
-  Socketio
-  eventlet

## Implementation steps:
1. Download the ZIP file provided by the teacher, extract and run the executable file
2. Unpack the downloaded Udacity Simulator package and click Run Beta_Simulator.exe. After running it, set the resolution and image quality first, starting with 640×480 and the Fastest, as shown below:

3. After setting, click Play to enter the simulator. After the simulator opens, click Training Mode, as shown below:

## Problems and solutions:
I found a mistake when downloading the installation package. After consulting Baidu, CSDN and my constant trial and error, I found the solution to the problem as the version problem, and finished the installation of the package after a series of trial and error, as shown below:

## Summary:
This project is very interesting. We can learn the methods of code in the game. We constantly tried and made mistakes and felt the fun of writing code.Thanks to professor and my classmates,with their help, I was able to finish the project well.
